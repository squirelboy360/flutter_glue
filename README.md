  <li>All Gradle or CocoaPod issues potentially solved before you encounter them</li>
  <li>Get Native app but with flexibility of painting your own pixels only for the view port given to you by native side ensuring, navigation and all native platform behaviours are natural to your users</li>
  <li>No abstraction, just see the native implemenatation right in your codebase</li>
</ol>
